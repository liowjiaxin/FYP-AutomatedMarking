Task1_student.zip,Task1_marking_scheme.pdf,7.0,"The implementation solves the task but lacks in various aspects. 

1. Code Comprehension: Shows understanding of prime number concept. No evidence of conceptual misunderstandings. 
2. Functional Correctness: Solves the problem but lacks checks for numbers < 2 and does not handle edge cases properly. More test cases needed for robustness. 
3. Code Quality: Needs improvement in comments and modularity. Readability is average. 
4. Technical Implementation: Efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing the loop for prime checking. No issues with language features or resource management. 
5. Testing & Verification: Lack of test cases and input validation. Debugging evidence is missing. 

Improvement Roadmap: 
- Add checks for numbers < 2. 
- Implement handling for edge cases like 2. 
- Increase test case coverage for robustness. 
- Enhance comments for better code understanding. 
- Refactor code for better modularity with named functions. 
- Optimize algorithm for prime checking. 
- Include more test cases and ensure input validation. 

Overall, a functional solution but with significant room for improvement."
