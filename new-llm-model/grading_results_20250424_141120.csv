The function correctly identifies prime numbers but fails to handle numbers less than 2, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the loop range logic is incorrect, affecting the divisibility check. It lacks handling for important edge cases like 2. Improvements are needed in handling edge cases, correcting the loop range, and enhancing code readability and formatting for better maintainability.'}"
