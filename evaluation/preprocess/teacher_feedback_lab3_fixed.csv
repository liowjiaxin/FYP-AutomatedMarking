Q2: q2-The AvailabilityStatus struct is defined with two boolean members (inStock and outOfStock), but only one of them is needed. This could lead to confusion about the availability status. A single boolean (e.g., isAvailable) or using a Union would suffice.

Q3: q3-Bubble Sort is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n²) in the worst and average cases. It is not ideal for larger datasets. While it is correctly implemented here, a more efficient algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort would be preferable for better performance.

Q2: q2-The AvailabilityStatus struct is defined but not necessary. You can determine if an item is in stock based solely on the quantity. You can simplify the code by removing this struct and using a boolean derived from the quantity in the GroceryItem struct or use a union.

This could lead to accessing outdated or invalid data if the last item was previously removed.
