The function is_leap_year() correctly implements the leap year logic, including the rule that years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless also divisible by 400. The logic is well-structured and accurate.

The use of a dedicated function promotes modularity and improves code readability. The function is accompanied by a clear and descriptive docstring that adheres to standard Python documentation practices, explaining the input and expected output clearly.

The program also includes user interaction via input, which enables dynamic testing and simulates a real-world usage scenario.

However, the function lacks inline comments to explain key logic decisions, such as the significance of the 100 and 400-year rules. Adding brief comments would improve readability, particularly for beginners or reviewers unfamiliar with the leap year rules.

Overall, this is a strong implementation with only minor improvements needed in code documentation.
