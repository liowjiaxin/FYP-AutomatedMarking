However, there are significant areas for improvement in code quality, error handling, and algorithm efficiency. \n\n**Question 1:** This question is implemented correctly, printing the grid as requested.  However, the code lacks comments explaining the logic, which is a significant deduction in code quality.  The use of more descriptive variable names (e.g., `numRows`, `numCols`) would enhance readability.\n\n**Question 2:** The calculation of the sum, average, and product is correct. However, the approach to finding the largest and smallest integers is inefficient and repetitive.  A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the numbers only once.  Furthermore, the code only handles three integers, failing to meet the requirement of handling a variable number of integers.  The lack of input validation (checking if the user entered numbers) is a significant flaw.  The use of `if` statements instead of a more concise approach (e.g., using `min` and `max` functions if available) also impacts code quality.\n\n**Question 3:** The switch statement correctly handles different product types. However, the discount calculation (`discprice = cost / discount;`) is incorrect; it should be `discprice = cost * (1 - discount / 100.0);`.  The use of integer variables for price and weight is problematic as it leads to loss of precision.  Floating-point variables (`float`) should be used instead.  The code lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative weight or price).  The repeated code blocks for each product type could be refactored into functions to improve modularity and readability.  The lack of comments further reduces the code quality.\n\n**Overall:** Your code is functional for the basic cases but lacks robustness, efficiency, and code quality.  Focus on improving your code structure, adding comprehensive comments, implementing proper error handling, and using more efficient algorithms.  Review the provided sample answers for better approaches to solving these problems.  Consider using more descriptive variable names and improving the overall readability of your code.

      "feedback": "Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are several areas needing significant improvement. \n\n**Q1:** The code for Q1 has a logical error in the loop structure.  The loop variable 'i' is used in both inner and outer loops, leading to incorrect output.  The variable 'width' is undefined.  You need to correct the loop structure to accurately print the grid based on the user-specified rows and columns.  While the input section is correct, the output generation is flawed.  Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of your code. \n\n**Q2:** The code for Q2 correctly calculates the sum, average, and product. However, the logic for finding the largest and smallest integers is unnecessarily complex and could be simplified.  The use of multiple if statements is acceptable given the assignment constraints, but a more efficient approach would improve code quality.  Input validation is missing; the program crashes if the user enters non-integer values.  Add comprehensive comments to improve readability and explain the logic. \n\n**Q3:** The code for Q3 uses a switch statement correctly to handle different product types. However, the discount calculation is flawed; it directly subtracts the discount value from the total cost instead of calculating the discounted price.  The program lacks input validation; it doesn't handle cases where the user enters invalid product codes or negative values for weight, quantity, or price.  The output formatting could be improved for better clarity.  Add comments to explain each step of the calculation and improve the overall readability. \n\n**General Feedback:**  All three programs lack sufficient comments.  Aim for a comment density of 20-30% to explain the logic and purpose of each code section.  Improve code readability by using consistent indentation and meaningful variable names.  Implement robust input validation to handle unexpected user inputs and prevent program crashes.  Consider using more efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate.  Thorough testing with various inputs (including edge cases and boundary conditions) is crucial to ensure the correctness and robustness of your programs.  The code quality needs significant improvement to meet the standards of this assignment.",

You also lack sufficient comments explaining the logic. \n\n**Q2:** The program only handles three integers, not a variable number as required.

While you used if-else statements correctly for finding the largest and smallest, the problem specified using only single-selection if statements, which you did not fully adhere to.  The code lacks error handling for non-integer inputs. \n\n**Q3:** The program structure is better, using a while loop and switch statement effectively. However, there are several issues:  The input for weight and quantity in cases 1 and 2 should be floats, not integers. The discount calculation is incorrect; it should subtract the discount from the total cost, not just calculate the discount amount.  The final cost output is missing from cases 1 and 2.  Error handling for invalid product codes is present but could be improved by providing more informative error messages.  The comments are sparse and could be more descriptive. \n\n**Overall:** Your code needs significant improvements in terms of functional correctness, error handling, and code quality.  Pay close attention to the problem specifications and use more descriptive variable names and comments.  Practice handling variable numbers of inputs and using appropriate data types.

      "feedback": "Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are several areas needing significant improvement. \n\n**Q1:** The code for Q1 has a logical error. You're asking for the number of columns twice, and your conditional statement within the inner loop doesn't correctly handle the newline character.  The output will not match the specified format.  You also lack comments explaining the logic.  \n\n**Q2:** The code for Q2 only handles three integers, not a variable number as requested.  While the if/else structure for finding the smallest and largest is correct, it's not efficient and doesn't scale.  The average calculation is also incorrect; you should cast one of the operands to float to get a floating-point result.  Again, comments are missing. \n\n**Q3:** The code for Q3 only handles the case of fruits and vegetables, ignoring dairy products and canned goods.  It also lacks the required switch statement and the program loop to allow multiple product entries.  The discount calculation is correct, but the overall structure is incomplete.  The lack of comments makes the code difficult to understand. \n\n**Overall:**  All three questions show a lack of attention to detail and incomplete implementation of the requirements.  The code lacks sufficient comments to explain the logic, and the modularity is poor.  You need to improve your understanding of loops, conditional statements, and input/output handling in C.  Focus on writing cleaner, more efficient, and well-documented code.  Consider using a more robust approach for handling user input (e.g., error checking) and implementing the variable number of integers in Q2.  Remember to thoroughly test your code with various inputs, including edge cases, before submission.",

However, there's room for significant improvement in code quality, modularity, and error handling. \n\n**Q1:** The asterisk grid program works correctly.  However, the comments are minimal and could be more descriptive.  Consider adding comments explaining the purpose of each loop and the overall logic. The spacing could also be improved for better readability. \n\n**Q2:** The integer calculation program is functional for three integers but lacks the flexibility to handle a variable number of inputs as specified in the question.  The use of separate functions for finding the smallest and largest integers is a positive step towards modularity, but the program should be designed to handle an arbitrary number of integers. Input validation is missing; the program doesn't handle non-integer inputs gracefully. \n\n**Q3:** The grocery store cost calculator program is mostly correct and uses a switch statement effectively. However, the code is repetitive; the sections for fruits, vegetables, dairy, and canned goods are nearly identical. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  Consider refactoring the code to reduce redundancy.  Also, add input validation to ensure the user enters valid data types (e.g., positive numbers for weight and quantity).  The comments are insufficient and should be more detailed. \n\n**Overall:** Your code is functional but lacks the polish and robustness expected for a higher grade.  Focus on improving code quality, modularity, error handling, and input validation.  Add more comprehensive and descriptive comments to explain the logic of your code.  Consider using more advanced C features where appropriate to improve efficiency and readability.  The use of functions in Q2 is a good start, but this should be applied more consistently across all questions to improve modularity and maintainability.",

All three questions are attempted and produce outputs that generally match the specifications. However, there are areas for significant improvement in code quality, efficiency, and robustness.\n\n**Q1:** The code correctly prints the asterisk grid. However, the comments are minimal and lack detail.  The spacing and variable names could be improved for readability (e.g., `clmns` should be `columns`).  Consider adding input validation to handle cases where the user enters non-positive numbers.\n\n**Q2:** This question's solution is functional but lacks error handling.  The program only accepts exactly three integers. A more robust solution would allow for a variable number of integers, handling potential errors in input (e.g., non-integer input). The use of single-selection `if` statements is correct, but the code could be more concise and efficient.  Consider using a loop to process multiple integers and using functions to improve modularity.\n\n**Q3:** The `switch` statement is implemented correctly, and the program handles different product types appropriately.  However, the code lacks sufficient comments to explain the logic clearly.  The input validation is minimal.  Consider adding more robust error handling (e.g., checking for negative weights or quantities).  The discount calculation is correctly implemented.  The overall structure is acceptable, but using functions to separate input, calculation, and output would improve modularity and readability.\n\n**Overall:** Your code is functional but needs significant improvements in code quality, error handling, and robustness.  Focus on writing cleaner, more modular code with comprehensive comments and input validation.  Consider using functions to break down the code into smaller, more manageable parts.  Improving these aspects will significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of your code and demonstrate a deeper understanding of programming principles.",

      "feedback": "Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts but contains several critical flaws that significantly impact functionality and code quality. \n\n**Q1:** The loop structure in Q1 is incorrect. The outer loop iterates through columns instead of rows, and the inner loop's condition is also flawed, leading to an incorrect number of asterisks printed.  The use of `scanf_s` is a good attempt at input validation, but it's not consistently applied and doesn't handle non-integer inputs.  There is a lack of comments explaining the logic. \n\n**Q2:**  The code in Q2 has multiple issues.  First, `count` is not initialized correctly; it should be initialized before the `scanf_s` call. Second, `integer` is not declared as an array, leading to undefined behavior.  The logic for calculating the smallest and largest integers is also flawed and doesn't correctly handle multiple inputs.  The `printf` statements for displaying the results are missing format specifiers.  There is no error handling for invalid input (non-numeric values).  The comments are insufficient and don't explain the logic clearly. \n\n**Q3:** The code in Q3 uses `scanf_s` which is not standard C.  The `switch` statement is correctly implemented, but the code lacks input validation (e.g., checking for negative quantities or prices).  The discount calculation is also incorrect; it should be `final = total * (1 - (float)discount / 100);` to ensure floating-point division.  The comments are minimal and don't adequately explain the logic.  The program doesn't handle invalid product codes gracefully. \n\nOverall, your code needs significant improvements in terms of correctness, error handling, and code quality.  Focus on understanding the logic of loops, array usage, input validation, and floating-point arithmetic.  Pay close attention to the provided sample outputs and ensure your code produces identical results.  Improve your commenting practices to enhance code readability and maintainability.  Consider using standard C functions instead of compiler-specific ones like `scanf_s`.",

      "feedback": "Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are significant areas needing improvement across multiple dimensions of the rubric. \n\n**Code Comprehension (5/10):** While you attempted to implement the core logic for each question, there are conceptual misunderstandings. For example, in Q1, you hardcoded the grid size instead of taking user input. In Q2, your average calculation is integer division, leading to inaccurate results. In Q3, your switch statement is incomplete and lacks proper cost calculation. \n\n**Functional Correctness (15/30):**  Q1 produces a fixed-size grid, failing to meet the requirement of user-specified dimensions. Q2 calculates the sum, product, and largest/smallest correctly for three integers but lacks error handling for invalid input and doesn't handle more than three integers. Q3 is largely non-functional due to incomplete switch cases and missing cost calculations.  No test cases are evident. \n\n**Code Quality (12/25):** Comments are sparse and lack clarity.  Modularity is absent; all code resides in the main function. Readability is hampered by inconsistent naming conventions and a lack of whitespace.  The `sum` function in Q1 is declared but never used. \n\n**Technical Implementation (10/25):** Algorithm efficiency is not optimal, especially in Q2 where it only handles three integers.  Inappropriate data types are used (integer division in Q2). Resource management is not a concern in this simple program. \n\n**Testing & Verification (8/10):**  No formal testing is present. Input validation is missing, particularly in Q2 and Q3. There's no evidence of debugging beyond basic compilation. \n\n**Specific Feedback per Question:**\n\n* **Q1:** Implement user input for rows and columns.  Use the input values in your loops.\n* **Q2:**  Handle more than three integers. Use `float` for the average calculation. Add input validation to ensure three integers are entered.\n* **Q3:** Complete the switch statement for all four product types.  Implement proper cost calculations for each type. Add input validation and error handling. \n\nTo improve your grade, focus on addressing the identified conceptual misunderstandings, improving code quality through better modularity, commenting, and readability, and implementing thorough testing and input validation.",
