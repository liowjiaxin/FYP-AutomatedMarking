20409676,6.5,"Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, successfully completing the core functionality of each question. However, there are significant areas for improvement in code quality, error handling, and algorithm efficiency. 

**Question 1:** This question is implemented correctly, printing the grid as requested.  However, the code lacks comments explaining the logic, which is a significant deduction in code quality.  The use of more descriptive variable names (e.g., `numRows`, `numCols`) would enhance readability.

**Question 2:** The calculation of the sum, average, and product is correct. However, the approach to finding the largest and smallest integers is inefficient and repetitive.  A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the numbers only once.  Furthermore, the code only handles three integers, failing to meet the requirement of handling a variable number of integers.  The lack of input validation (checking if the user entered numbers) is a significant flaw.  The use of `if` statements instead of a more concise approach (e.g., using `min` and `max` functions if available) also impacts code quality.

**Question 3:** The switch statement correctly handles different product types. However, the discount calculation (`discprice = cost / discount;`) is incorrect; it should be `discprice = cost * (1 - discount / 100.0);`.  The use of integer variables for price and weight is problematic as it leads to loss of precision.  Floating-point variables (`float`) should be used instead.  The code lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative weight or price).  The repeated code blocks for each product type could be refactored into functions to improve modularity and readability.  The lack of comments further reduces the code quality.

**Overall:** Your code is functional for the basic cases but lacks robustness, efficiency, and code quality.  Focus on improving your code structure, adding comprehensive comments, implementing proper error handling, and using more efficient algorithms.  Review the provided sample answers for better approaches to solving these problems.  Consider using more descriptive variable names and improving the overall readability of your code.  Remember to always validate user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior."
20577892,6.5,"Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are several areas needing significant improvement. 

**Q1:** The code for Q1 has a logical error in the loop structure.  The loop variable 'i' is used in both inner and outer loops, leading to incorrect output.  The variable 'width' is undefined.  You need to correct the loop structure to accurately print the grid based on the user-specified rows and columns.  While the input section is correct, the output generation is flawed.  Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of your code. 

**Q2:** The code for Q2 correctly calculates the sum, average, and product. However, the logic for finding the largest and smallest integers is unnecessarily complex and could be simplified.  The use of multiple if statements is acceptable given the assignment constraints, but a more efficient approach would improve code quality.  Input validation is missing; the program crashes if the user enters non-integer values.  Add comprehensive comments to improve readability and explain the logic. 

**Q3:** The code for Q3 uses a switch statement correctly to handle different product types. However, the discount calculation is flawed; it directly subtracts the discount value from the total cost instead of calculating the discounted price.  The program lacks input validation; it doesn't handle cases where the user enters invalid product codes or negative values for weight, quantity, or price.  The output formatting could be improved for better clarity.  Add comments to explain each step of the calculation and improve the overall readability. 

**General Feedback:**  All three programs lack sufficient comments.  Aim for a comment density of 20-30% to explain the logic and purpose of each code section.  Improve code readability by using consistent indentation and meaningful variable names.  Implement robust input validation to handle unexpected user inputs and prevent program crashes.  Consider using more efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate.  Thorough testing with various inputs (including edge cases and boundary conditions) is crucial to ensure the correctness and robustness of your programs.  The code quality needs significant improvement to meet the standards of this assignment."
20580127,6.5,"Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are several areas needing significant improvement. 

**Q1:** The grid output is incorrect. Your nested loops don't produce the expected output. The inner loop's starting index is wrong, and the spacing between asterisks is inconsistent.  You also lack sufficient comments explaining the logic. 

**Q2:** The program only handles three integers, not a variable number as required.  The average calculation is integer division, leading to inaccurate results.  While you used if-else statements correctly for finding the largest and smallest, the problem specified using only single-selection if statements, which you did not fully adhere to.  The code lacks error handling for non-integer inputs. 

**Q3:** The program structure is better, using a while loop and switch statement effectively. However, there are several issues:  The input for weight and quantity in cases 1 and 2 should be floats, not integers. The discount calculation is incorrect; it should subtract the discount from the total cost, not just calculate the discount amount.  The final cost output is missing from cases 1 and 2.  Error handling for invalid product codes is present but could be improved by providing more informative error messages.  The comments are sparse and could be more descriptive. 

**Overall:** Your code needs significant improvements in terms of functional correctness, error handling, and code quality.  Pay close attention to the problem specifications and use more descriptive variable names and comments.  Practice handling variable numbers of inputs and using appropriate data types.  Review the concepts of floating-point arithmetic and percentage calculations.  Consider using a debugger to identify and fix logical errors in your code.  Remember to thoroughly test your code with various inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions."
20602511,7.5,"Your submission demonstrates a functional understanding of basic C programming concepts, successfully completing the core requirements of each question. However, there's room for significant improvement in code quality, efficiency, and error handling. 

**Question 1:** This question is well-solved. The nested loops correctly generate the grid, and the input/output is as expected.  However, the variable names (loop1, loop2) are not descriptive. Using `row` and `col` would improve readability.  Also, adding comments explaining the purpose of each loop would enhance clarity.

**Question 2:** The program calculates the sum, average, and product correctly.  The approach to finding the smallest and largest integers is inefficient and repetitive.  A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the numbers only once, updating the smallest and largest values as you go. The use of multiple if-else statements is acceptable given the assignment constraints, but a more concise and efficient solution is possible.  Error handling for non-integer inputs is missing. 

**Question 3:** The switch statement is correctly implemented to handle different product types. However, the code is unnecessarily repetitive. The calculation of `totalCost` and `finalCost` is repeated for each case. This can be refactored into a single block of code executed after the switch statement.  The discount calculation is also not robust; it doesn't handle negative discount values.  Input validation is minimal.  The program should check for invalid inputs (e.g., negative weight, quantity, price).

**Overall:** Your code is functional but lacks polish and efficiency.  Focus on improving code readability, modularity, and error handling.  Use more descriptive variable names, reduce code duplication, and implement robust input validation.  Consider using more efficient algorithms where applicable.  Adding more comprehensive comments would also significantly improve the code's clarity and maintainability.  While the code works for the given test cases, it lacks the robustness and efficiency expected in a professional setting."
20607863,7.5,"Your submission demonstrates a good understanding of basic C programming concepts and successfully implements the core functionalities of each question. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of code quality, error handling, and efficiency.

**Question 1:** This is well-done. The nested loops correctly generate the grid, and the input/output is as expected.  Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each loop and variable. 

**Question 2:** The calculation of sum, average, product, minimum, and maximum is correct. However, the program only handles exactly three integer inputs.  A more robust solution would allow the user to input a variable number of integers, as specified in the question.  Error handling (e.g., checking for non-integer input) is missing.  The use of only single-selection if statements is unnecessarily restrictive and makes the code less readable. Consider using a `while` loop to read integers until a non-integer is encountered, and then calculate the results.  

**Question 3:** The program structure using a `while` loop and `switch` statement is appropriate. The cost calculations for each product type are correct. However, the program lacks input validation. It doesn't check for negative weights, quantities, or prices.  Adding input validation would significantly improve the robustness of your program.  Also, consider using functions to modularize the code and improve readability.  For example, create separate functions for each product type's cost calculation.  The comments are sparse; adding more comments to explain the logic of each section would enhance readability.

**Overall:** Your code is functional for the given test cases, but it needs significant improvements in terms of robustness, error handling, and code quality.  Focus on improving input validation, handling variable numbers of inputs (Question 2), and modularizing your code using functions (Question 3).  Adding more comprehensive comments will also improve the readability and maintainability of your code.  Aim for a higher comment-to-code ratio (around 20-30%)."
20611251,6.5,"Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, successfully completing the core functionality of each question. However, there are several areas needing significant improvement to meet the standards of this assignment.

**Q1:** The code correctly prints the asterisk grid; however, it lacks comments explaining the logic, which is a significant part of the grading rubric.  The spacing between asterisks is not consistent with the sample output. 

**Q2:** The program calculates the sum, average, product, smallest, and largest of three integers.  The use of if-else statements is not optimal and could be simplified.  The program does not handle cases where the user inputs non-integer values, leading to potential errors.  The average calculation should use floating-point division for better accuracy.  Again, comments are missing.

**Q3:** The program structure is acceptable, using a switch statement to handle different product types. However, the input validation is minimal.  The discount calculation has a potential error in its formula.  The program lacks error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative weight or price).  The use of comments is insufficient.  The program does not clearly separate input, processing, and output sections, making it less readable.

**Overall:** The code is functional for the most part, but it lacks crucial elements of good programming practice.  The consistent absence of comments, suboptimal algorithm choices (especially in Q2), and insufficient error handling significantly detract from the quality of the submission.  You need to improve your code commenting, error handling, and algorithm design to achieve a higher grade.  Refer to the provided sample answers for guidance on improving your code structure, input validation, and output formatting.  Consider using more descriptive variable names and organizing your code into logical blocks to enhance readability.  Remember that clear, concise, and well-placed comments are essential for understanding and maintaining your code."
20611605,7.2,"Your submission demonstrates a functional understanding of basic C programming concepts, successfully completing the core requirements of each question. However, there's significant room for improvement in code quality, efficiency, and error handling. 

**Q1:**  The code for Question 1 is concise and correctly generates the asterisk grid.  However, it lacks comments explaining the logic, which is a significant omission given the assignment's instructions.  

**Q2:** The solution to Question 2 attempts to handle the calculation of sum, average, product, smallest, and largest integers. The approach using multiple if-else statements to find the smallest and largest values is inefficient and doesn't scale well for more than three integers.  The code lacks input validation; it assumes the user will always enter three valid integers.  More robust error handling is needed to gracefully handle invalid input (non-numeric values, fewer than three integers).  The comments are minimal.

**Q3:** Question 3 shows a reasonable attempt at using a switch statement to handle different product types. However, the repetitive code for calculating the cost for each product type indicates a lack of modularity.  The code could be significantly improved by creating functions for cost calculation and discount application.  The error handling is also insufficient; it doesn't handle invalid product codes gracefully.  The comments are again minimal. 

**Overall:** The code is functional but lacks crucial software engineering best practices.  The comments are sparse, the code is not modular, and error handling is weak.  To improve your score, focus on:

* **Improving code quality:** Add comprehensive comments to explain the logic of each section.  Break down the code into smaller, well-defined functions to improve readability and maintainability.  
* **Enhancing error handling:** Implement robust input validation to handle invalid user inputs and edge cases.  Provide informative error messages to guide the user. 
* **Improving efficiency:** Use more efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate. For example, in Q2, use a loop to handle an arbitrary number of integers and find the smallest and largest values efficiently. 
* **Adhering to coding style guidelines:** Use consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions to improve code readability."
20613250,7.5,"Your submission demonstrates a functional understanding of basic C programming concepts, successfully completing the core requirements of each question. However, there's room for improvement in code quality, efficiency, and error handling.

**Strengths:**

* **Functionality:** All three programs execute and produce outputs as specified in the assignment.  The logic for the grid printing (Q1), calculations (Q2), and grocery cost calculation (Q3) is largely correct.
* **Structure:** Your code is generally well-structured, using loops and conditional statements appropriately. The use of a function in Q3 to handle discount calculations is a positive step towards modularity.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Code Quality:**
    * **Comments:**  The comments are sparse and lack detail.  More descriptive comments explaining the purpose of code blocks and complex logic are needed. Aim for a higher comment density (20-30% is a good target).
    * **Modularity:** While Q3 uses a function, Q1 and Q2 could benefit from breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions. This improves readability and maintainability.
    * **Readability:** Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `num1`, `num2`, `num3` could be `integer1`, `integer2`, `integer3`). Consistent indentation and spacing would enhance readability.
* **Error Handling:**  Your programs lack robust error handling. For example, Q2 assumes the user will always enter three integers.  Q3 doesn't handle non-numeric input effectively.  Implement input validation to check for invalid data types and handle them gracefully (e.g., display an error message and prompt the user again).
* **Efficiency:** In Q2, you could use a loop to handle an arbitrary number of integers instead of being limited to three.  This would make the code more flexible and efficient.
* **Algorithm Efficiency:** The nested loops in Q1 are fine for small grids, but for very large grids, the efficiency could be improved.  Consider the time complexity of your algorithms.
* **Testing:**  You haven't provided any evidence of testing.  Include test cases (basic, edge, and stress cases) to demonstrate the correctness and robustness of your code.

**Specific Feedback per Question:**

* **Q1:** The loop structure is correct, but the code could be more concise and readable.  Consider using a `do-while` loop to ensure at least one row is printed.
* **Q2:** The if-else structure is correct, but it's not very efficient for a larger number of integers.  Use a loop and keep track of the minimum and maximum values as you iterate.
* **Q3:** The use of a function is good, but the discount calculation within the `counting` function could be simplified.  The `switch` statement is well-implemented.

**Recommendations:**

* Review C programming best practices, focusing on code style, modularity, and error handling.
* Practice writing more comprehensive comments to explain your code's logic.
* Design and implement thorough test cases to verify the correctness of your programs.
* Explore more efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate."

**Q1:** The asterisk grid program works correctly.  However, the comments are minimal, and the code lacks modularity.  Consider using functions to separate input, grid generation, and output for better organization and readability.  The spacing around operators could also be improved for better readability.

**Q2:** The integer calculation program functions correctly for three integers.  The use of if-else statements is appropriate, but the code is not designed to handle more than three integers.  A more robust solution would use arrays or dynamic memory allocation to accommodate a variable number of inputs, as shown in Sample Answer 2.  Error handling for non-integer inputs is missing.  The comments are insufficient.

**Q3:** The grocery store program demonstrates a good understanding of switch statements and loops.  However, the code is repetitive (the calculation of cost and discount is repeated for each product type).  This repetition violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  Consider creating functions to encapsulate the common calculation logic.  The program lacks input validation (e.g., checking for negative weights or quantities).  The comments are inadequate.  The use of integers for price and weight might lead to loss of precision. Using floats would be more appropriate.

20718864,6.0,"Your submission demonstrates a basic understanding of C programming, but there are significant areas needing improvement across multiple dimensions of the rubric. 

**Code Comprehension (5/10):** While you attempted to implement the core logic for each question, there are conceptual misunderstandings. For example, in Q1, you hardcoded the grid size instead of taking user input. In Q2, your average calculation is integer division, leading to inaccurate results. In Q3, your switch statement is incomplete and lacks proper cost calculation. 

**Functional Correctness (15/30):**  Q1 produces a fixed-size grid, failing to meet the requirement of user-specified dimensions. Q2 calculates the sum, product, and largest/smallest correctly for three integers but lacks error handling for invalid input and doesn't handle more than three integers. Q3 is largely non-functional due to incomplete switch cases and missing cost calculations.  No test cases are evident. 

**Code Quality (12/25):** Comments are sparse and lack clarity.  Modularity is absent; all code resides in the main function. Readability is hampered by inconsistent naming conventions and a lack of whitespace.  The `sum` function in Q1 is declared but never used. 

**Technical Implementation (10/25):** Algorithm efficiency is not optimal, especially in Q2 where it only handles three integers.  Inappropriate data types are used (integer division in Q2). Resource management is not a concern in this simple program. 

**Testing & Verification (8/10):**  No formal testing is present. Input validation is missing, particularly in Q2 and Q3. There's no evidence of debugging beyond basic compilation.

However, the code is repetitive; the calculation of total and final cost is repeated for each product type.  This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  Consider creating a function to encapsulate this calculation.  The code also lacks input validation; it doesn't check for negative weights, quantities, or prices.  Adding input validation and error handling would make the program more robust.  The comments are insufficient and could be more detailed. 

**Overall:** Your code is functional but lacks the polish and robustness expected in a well-structured program.  Focus on improving code quality through better commenting, modularity, error handling, and input validation.  Consider using more efficient algorithms and data structures where appropriate.  Aim for a higher comment-to-code ratio (around 20-30%).  The repetitive nature of the code in Q3 needs to be addressed.  Improving these aspects will significantly enhance your code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality."
20722250,7.5,"Your submission demonstrates a good understanding of basic C programming concepts and successfully completes the core functionality of each question. However, there are areas for improvement in code quality, efficiency, and error handling.

**Q1:** The code correctly prints the grid of asterisks.  However, the spacing between asterisks is not consistent with the sample output (it should be ""* "").  Adding a space within the printf statement in the inner loop would resolve this.  The comments are minimal and could be more descriptive.

**Q2:** The program calculates the sum, average, product, minimum, and maximum correctly for three integers.  The use of if-else if statements is acceptable, although a more concise approach using min/max functions would be more efficient and readable.  Error handling for non-integer inputs is missing.  The program should check the return value of scanf to ensure that three integers were successfully read.

**Q3:** This question shows good use of a switch statement and a while loop to handle multiple product types and user input.  The code correctly calculates the total and final cost after discount.  However, error handling is again lacking.  The program should validate user input (e.g., ensuring that weight and quantity are non-negative).  The use of fflush(stdin) is generally discouraged as it's not portable.  Consider using a loop to consume any remaining characters in the input buffer instead.

**Overall:** Your code is functional but lacks robustness and could be significantly improved in terms of code quality and error handling.  Adding more comprehensive comments, improving input validation, and using more efficient algorithms would significantly enhance your submission.  Consider exploring more advanced C features and standard library functions to write more concise and efficient code.  Aim for a higher comment-to-code ratio (around 20-30%).  The current code is closer to 10%, which is too low."
20722371,7.2,"Your submission demonstrates a functional understanding of basic C programming concepts, successfully completing the core requirements of each question. However, there's significant room for improvement in code quality, efficiency, and error handling. 

**Q1:** This question is well-solved. The nested loops correctly generate the grid.  However, the code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each loop and variable, reducing readability.  Consider adding comments to improve the code's clarity and maintainability.  Also, the prompt asks for ""* "", but your code outputs ""*"".

**Q2:** The program calculates the sum, average, and product correctly. However, the logic for finding the smallest and largest integers is unnecessarily complex and inefficient.  A more efficient approach would involve iterating through the numbers only once.  The use of nested if statements, while fulfilling the requirement, is less readable than a more concise approach.  Furthermore, the program only handles three integers, failing to meet the requirement of handling a variable number of integers.  Error handling for non-integer inputs is missing.

**Q3:** The switch statement correctly handles different product types. However, the code is repetitive, with almost identical blocks for fruits, vegetables, and canned goods.  This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  The code should be refactored to avoid this repetition.  Also, the program uses integers for weight and price, which can lead to inaccuracies.  Using floats would be more appropriate.  Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative weight or price) is absent.  The discount calculation is correct, but the prompt asks for the total cost *before* discount, which is missing from the output.  Finally, the program doesn't handle the case where the user enters a non-numeric value for the product code or other inputs. 

**Overall:** Your code is functional but lacks robustness, efficiency, and adherence to good coding practices.  Focus on improving code structure, adding comprehensive comments, implementing efficient algorithms, and incorporating robust error handling to significantly enhance your code quality.  Consider using functions to modularize your code and improve readability.  Pay close attention to the specific requirements of each question, ensuring your code addresses all aspects of the problem statement."
